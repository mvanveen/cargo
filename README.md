**Docker Containers for Humansâ„¢**

![](supply_crate.jpg)

**:warning: WARNING** *This is a very early alpha release of cargo.  All development 
for this project is being done in the open.  Contributions are totally welcome, but 
please at least announce and discuss your plans via an issue before submitting a pull 
request so we can all collectively create something beautiful!*

## Examples

**inspect container logs**

In this exzmple we are running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` to fire up a basic HTTP 
server on port `8000`.  We use `container.ports` to grab out the forwarded port, 
issue an HTTP `GET`, and then inspect the subsequent container logs, which now contain 
an apache logs entry for our `GET` request, :sparkles: as if by magic! :sparkles:

```python
>>> import cargo
>>> import requests
>>> container.command
u'python -m SimpleHTTPServer'
>>> container = cargo.ps()[0]
>>> container.logs
u''
>>> requests.get('http://localhost:%s' % (container.ports[0][0]))
<Response [200]>
>>> container.logs
u'172.16.42.1 - - [11/Aug/2013 12:49:56] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -\n'
```

**inspect currently running local containers**

```python
>>> from cargo import Dock
>>> d = Dock()
>>> d 
<Dock [http://localhost:4243] (1.3)>
>>> d.containers
[<Container [9a7a6a52171d]>, <Container [b575c9ece1b9]>, <Container [b225c9398c4b]>]
```

Alternatively, you can get the same result with `cargo.ps`:

```python
>>> import cargo
>>> cargo.ps()
[<Container [9a7a6a52171d]>, <Container [b575c9ece1b9]>, <Container [b225c9398c4b]>]
```

**inspect command string running in container**

```python
>>> container = d.containers[0]
>>> container.command
u'python -m SimpleHTTPServer'
```

**inspect forwarded container ports**

In this example, we're forwarding port `49155` locally to port 
`8000` within the container.

```python
>>> container = d.containers[0]
>>> container.ports
[(49155, 8000)]
```
